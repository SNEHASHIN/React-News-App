            The format of a special report or breaking news event on broadcast
            television commonly consists of the following: When a news event
            warrants an interruption of current non-news programming (or, in
            some cases, regularly scheduled newscasts), the broadcaster will
            usually alert all of its affiliates via an internal alert/message
            service telling them to stand by for the interruption. After some
            time, the network's feed will suddenly switch to a reverse
            countdown, usually from 5 seconds, to allow any affiliated stations
            to switch to the network feed (television stations typically do not
            provide these countdowns for local coverage, merely leading with a
            graphic and voiceover announcing the cut-in). If a national network
            newscast is in progress when the breaking news event occurs, the
            newscast will pause temporarily to allow other network affiliates to
            join the feed. There is then an opening graphic, featuring music
            (such as NBC's "The Pulse of Events", composed by John Williams)
            which adds an emphasis on the importance of the event. The open is
            followed by the introduction of a news anchor, who welcomes the
            viewer to the broadcast and introduces the story at hand. Lower
            thirds and other graphics may also be altered to convey a sense of
            urgency. Once the story is introduced, the network or local station
            may, if possible, choose to continue to show a live shot of the
            anchor or may cut away to video or images of the story that is being
            followed during the broadcast. Additionally, the coverage may be
            passed to a reporter at the location of the breaking event, possibly
            sharing more information about the story as it breaks. Depending on
            the story being followed, the report may last only a few minutes, or
            continue for multiple hours – or with the longest uninterrupted news
            events, for days at a time –(events in which the latter instances
            has occurred include the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the
            September 11 attacks, which took place between November 22–26, 1963
            and September 11–15, 2001, respectively). If coverage continues for
            an extended amount of time, the network may integrate analysis about
            the story through analysts in-studio, via phone, satellite,
            broadband (B-GAN) or through other means of communication. Depending
            on the severity of the event, regular commercial advertising may be
            suspended entirely for sustained coverage. Network affiliates will
            be required to insert their station identification in at the top of
            the hour overlaid during the report rather than through the usual
            means of a station imaging promo or program reminder.
